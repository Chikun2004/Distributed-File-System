# Distributed File System (DFS)

A sophisticated distributed file system built with MERN stack featuring advanced capabilities including sharding, real-time synchronization, version control, and end-to-end encryption.

## Key Features

- 📁 Distributed File Storage with Sharding
- 🔄 Real-time File Synchronization
- 📝 Version Control System
- 🔒 End-to-End Encryption
- 🎯 File Deduplication
- 👥 Access Control and Permissions
- 🗑️ File Recovery and Trash System
- 👥 Real-time Collaboration
- 👀 File Preview System
- 📊 Analytics Dashboard

## Tech Stack

- MongoDB (with Sharding)
- Express.js
- React.js
- Node.js
- Socket.IO for real-time features
- Redis for caching
- JWT for authentication
- AWS S3 compatible storage
- Docker & Docker Compose

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 16.x
- MongoDB >= 5.0
- Redis >= 6.0
- Docker & Docker Compose

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Install backend dependencies
   cd server
   npm install

   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Start the development servers:
   ```bash
   # Start backend
   cd server
   npm run dev

   # Start frontend
   cd ../client
   npm start
   ```

## Architecture

The system follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

- Authentication Service
- File Management Service
- Storage Service
- Synchronization Service
- Analytics Service

## Security Features

- End-to-end encryption for file storage
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- File encryption at rest
- Secure file sharing with expirable links

## Performance Optimizations

- Redis caching for frequently accessed files
- File chunking for large file uploads
- Content-based deduplication
- Load balancing across shards
- CDN integration for fast file delivery
