# Client Documentation

## Overview
The client-side application is built using modern web technologies and follows a component-based architecture. It provides a robust, secure, and user-friendly interface for interacting with the distributed file system.

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **UI Components**: Custom components with Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth system
- **File Handling**: Custom drag-and-drop implementation

## Core Components

### 1. Authentication System
- Located in `src/context/AuthContext.tsx`
- Provides user authentication state management
- Features:
  - JWT-based authentication
  - Persistent sessions
  - Protected routes
  - Login/Signup flows

### 2. File Manager
- Located in `src/components/FileManager/index.tsx`
- Core features:
  - File listing and navigation
  - Drag-and-drop file upload
  - File operations (rename, delete, move)
  - Directory management
  - Access control integration

### 3. User Interface
#### Main Components
- **DragDropZone**: Handles file upload interactions
- **Sidebar**: Navigation and system structure
- **Command**: Command palette for quick actions
- **Table**: Data display component

#### UI Components Library
Located in `src/components/ui/`:
- Input controls
- Modal dialogs
- Toast notifications
- Pagination
- Menubar
- Calendar
- Toggle switches
- Radio groups
- Collapsible sections

## State Management
- **Authentication State**: Managed by AuthContext
- **File System State**: Local component state with context
- **UI State**: Component-level state management

## Security Features
1. Protected Routes
2. JWT Token Management
3. Secure File Transfer
4. Input Validation
5. CSRF Protection

## Performance Optimizations
1. Lazy Loading
   - Route-based code splitting
   - Dynamic imports for heavy components

2. File Handling
   - Chunked file uploads
   - Efficient file list virtualization
   - Caching strategies

3. UI Optimizations
   - Debounced inputs
   - Memoized components
   - Efficient re-rendering

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation
1. Navigate to the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Best Practices
1. **Component Design**
   - Single responsibility principle
   - Proper prop typing
   - Error boundary implementation

2. **State Management**
   - Minimize prop drilling
   - Use context appropriately
   - Local state when possible

3. **Performance**
   - Implement proper memoization
   - Optimize re-renders
   - Lazy load when appropriate

4. **Security**
   - Validate all inputs
   - Sanitize file uploads
   - Implement proper access controls

## Error Handling
- Global error boundaries
- Graceful degradation
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic retry mechanisms
- Offline support strategies

## Testing
Testing utilities and patterns are set up for:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Component tests
- End-to-end testing

## Contributing
When contributing to the client codebase:
1. Follow the established code style
2. Write tests for new features
3. Update documentation
4. Use conventional commits
5. Submit PRs against the development branch
