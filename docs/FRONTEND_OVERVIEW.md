# Frontend Documentation

## Overview
The frontend of the Distributed File System is built using React.js and provides a modern, user-friendly interface for file management, collaboration, and analytics. This document provides a comprehensive guide to the frontend architecture and components.

## Architecture
The frontend follows a component-based architecture with the following main sections:
- File Manager: Core file management interface
- Analytics Dashboard: Data visualization and system metrics
- Authentication: User login and registration flows

## Key Components
1. **File Manager (`FileManager.js`)**
   - File upload/download functionality
   - Directory navigation
   - File operations (rename, delete, move)
   - Sharing interface

2. **Analytics Dashboard (`AnalyticsDashboard.js`)**
   - Storage usage metrics
   - User activity tracking
   - System performance indicators

## State Management
- Local component state for UI interactions
- Redux for global state management
- Real-time updates using WebSocket connections

## API Integration
The frontend communicates with the backend through RESTful APIs for:
- File operations
- User authentication
- Analytics data
- Sharing and collaboration features

## Security
- JWT-based authentication
- Secure file transfer protocols
- Access control implementation
- CSRF protection

## Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading of components
- Efficient file chunk handling
- Caching strategies
- Image optimization

## Getting Started
1. Navigate to the `client` directory
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start development server: `npm start`
4. Build for production: `npm run build`
