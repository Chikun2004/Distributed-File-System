## Technical Interview Questions

### Programming Fundamentals

**Q: Explain SOLID principles with examples from your DFS project.**
A: 
1. Single Responsibility:
```javascript
// File Service example
class FileService {
    async uploadFile() { /* ... */ }
    async downloadFile() { /* ... */ }
}

class FilePermissionService {
    async checkPermissions() { /* ... */ }
}
```

2. Open/Closed:
```javascript
// Extension without modification
class BaseStorage {
    async store() { /* ... */ }
}

class S3Storage extends BaseStorage {
    async store() { /* ... */ }
}
```

### System Design Deep Dive

**Q: Design a distributed cache for your file system**
A: Explain:
1. Architecture:
```javascript
class DistributedCache {
    constructor() {
        this.redis = new Redis(config);
        this.localCache = new Map();
    }

    async get(key) {
        // Check local cache first
        if (this.localCache.has(key)) {
            return this.localCache.get(key);
        }
        
        // Check Redis
        const value = await this.redis.get(key);
        if (value) {
            this.localCache.set(key, value);
        }
        return value;
    }
}
```

2. Consistency mechanisms
3. Eviction policies
4. Failure handling

### Real-world Problem Solving

**Q: How would you handle a sudden spike in file upload requests?**
A: Explain your solution:
1. Load balancing strategy
2. Auto-scaling mechanisms
3. Rate limiting implementation
4. Queue-based processing

Example implementation:
```javascript
class UploadHandler {
    constructor() {
        this.queue = new Bull('fileUploads');
        this.rateLimiter = new RateLimiter({
            windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
            max: 100
        });
    }

    async handleUpload(file) {
        await this.rateLimiter.check();
        await this.queue.add({ file });
    }
}
```
